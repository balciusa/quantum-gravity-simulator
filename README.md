# Quantum Gravity Simulator

This project tests the hypothesis that gravitational time dilation can be simulated as computational latency on a quantum computer by increasing circuit depth.

- ðŸ”¬ **Backend:** IonQ QPU via Azure Quantum
- ðŸ’¡ **Concept:** Gravity = Computational Delay
- ðŸ§  **Inspired by:** Simulation Theory, Quantum Consciousness

## Run It Yourself
1. Update `main.py` with your Azure credentials.
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install qiskit azure-quantum
